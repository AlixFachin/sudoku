# Sudoku

## Description

This small project is one I did to teach JavaScript / web programming to a relative of mine.
The idea is to take a game which everybody knows, and once the main backbone is done (data structure, component hierarchy), we can begin to collaborate and work together towards a completed goal.

## Thanks to

- This project was done in `Svelte`, and scaffolded with `Vite`. Big thanks to both of those teams to make such incredible products!
